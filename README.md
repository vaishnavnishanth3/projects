# My Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of all the projects I’ve worked on — spanning frontend, backend, databases, and more.  
It serves as my playground for learning, experimenting, and building.

## Tech Stack Highlights

You’ll find projects built with a wide variety of technologies, including:

-   **Frontend** → HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
-   **Backend** → Node.js, Express
-   **Databases** → PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
-   **Other Languages** → Python, Java
-   **APIs** → RESTful APIs

And the list will keep growing as I continue to learn and build more projects.

## Structure

Each project lives in its own folder with a clear name, so it’s easy to navigate. Example:

```
/projects
├── netflix-clone/ # React + CSS
├── blog-api/ # Express + MongoDB
├── portfolio-site/ # HTML, CSS, JS
├── ecommerce-db/ # PostgreSQL
└── ...
```
